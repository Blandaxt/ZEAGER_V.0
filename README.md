# Unity_Game
First version of my UNITY based game in C# re-submit

## Game Name: ~ ZEAGER_V.0 ~


ZEAGER is the name of my game i created with unity in C#. This game has one character you can use to move around within the game. While moving, i have set up some objects that the character object can collect and will be displayed in a counter. 

## How it is made:

This project uses the UNITY engine to create everythin in the project. I aquired some free source external assets that i downloaded into the UNITY app. I then used these assets to create my game. Some examples include, SpriteSheets, TileSheets, Audio for sound effects, Graphical effects like particles and coded the Scripts in C#. 

### Time: 

If i had more time, i would add more functionality to my game by creating a U.I with statistical content like player health, player equipment, and other information. 

I would also have expanded the world the character can explore before seting the project online to download. 

I will keep updating this app in the future.
